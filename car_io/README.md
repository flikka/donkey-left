# Car IO 
Put the things needed to interact with the "car" here.

Likely, it will be a python program (or more) that captures and stores images from the camera.
It will also be a program that runs and receives commands for steering, and sends them to the donkey.

Implement these without contact with car first, ie. generate image (or capture from webcam), and for the steering, receive the input, and perhaps store it with a timestamp for debugging.

The fun part is in the agents folder.
